# LiMP
*LiMP* A Custom (Li)ghtweight (M)usic (P)layer, written in PHP and JavaScript.

# Structure
LiMP relies on a certain structure to generate the list of music:
```
LiMP
│   index.php
│   brain.js    
│
└───musicFolder1
│   │   musicFile1.mp3
│   │   musicFile2.mp3
│   │
│   └───subfolder1
│       │   musicFile3.mp3
│       │   musicFile4.wav
│       │   ...
│   
└───musicFolder2
    │   musicFile5.mp3
    │   musicFile6.wav
```

# TODO
